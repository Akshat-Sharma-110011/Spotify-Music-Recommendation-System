# Spotify-Music-Recommendation-System
Welcome to the Music Recommendation System! This web application uses data-driven methods to recommend music based on your preferences. You can discover new tracks through mood-based recommendations, playlist generation (such as workout or study playlists), or similarity-based suggestions from a selected song. It's powered by Streamlit, machine learning models, and Spotify data!

2. Playlist Creation
Create playlists tailored for different activities, including:

Workout üèãÔ∏è: Energetic music to keep you going.
Study üìö: Relaxing tracks for concentration.
Chill üßò: Soothing music for unwinding.
3. Similarity-Based Recommendations
Input a song you love and receive personalized music suggestions based on similar tracks.
